# NeuralNetworkMNIST

## About this project

With the rise of our AI overlords soon approaching, I thought it would be a good idea to know how
a neural network really works. To do this, I decided to create a neural network without the use of a ML libraries
like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Instead, I just used good ol' Python (And NumPy because matrix manipulation is a pain)
